    """Merge multiple headers into a single dict.

    Given a list of dict-like data headers, combine them following the
    specified mode.

    Parameters
    ----------
    headers : `list` of `dict` (or `dict`-like)
        Collection of headers to combine. `~lsst.daf.base.PropertyList`
        is supported.
    mode : `str`
        Scheme to use when a header has the same key as another header
        but different value. Options are:

        - ``'overwrite'`` : Value in later header overwrites earlier value.
        - ``'drop'`` : Entire key is dropped. If a key only appears in a
          subset of the headers, and is identical in those, it will be
          retained.
        - ``'diff'`` : As for ``drop`` but the dropped values are stored in a
          `list` of `dict` in the returned merged header in key
          ``__DIFF__``.  The order used matches the supplied order or
          the sorted order if specified.  This allows a simple header diff
          to be performed and associated with the original headers. Only
          keys that appear in all headers will be retained in the merged one.
          Unlike for ``'drop'`` headers that are identical and only present in
          a subset will always be included in the diff.
        - ``'first'`` : Retain first value encountered.
        - ``'append'`` : Convert value to list with a value for each header
          (`None` if the key was not present). If the value is
          identical in multiple headers but key is missing in
          some, then the single identical header is stored.
    sort : `bool`, optional
        If `True`, sort the supplied headers into date order if possible.
        This affects the resulting merged output depending on the requested
        merge mode.  An attempt will be made to extract a date from the
        headers.
    first : `list` or `tuple`, optional
        Keys to retain even if they differ.  For all modes excepting ``append``
        (where it is ignored) the value in the merged header will always be
        the value first encountered.  This is usually to allow time-dependent
        headers such as ``DATE-OBS`` and ``AZSTART`` to be retained to allow
        the header to indicate the range of values.  No exception is raised if
        a key can not be found in a header since this allows a range of
        expected headers to be listed covering multiple instruments.
    last : `list` or `tuple`, optional
        Keys to retain even if they differ.  For all modes excepting ``append``
        (where it is ignored) the value in the merged header will always be
        the final value encountered.  This is usually to allow time-dependent
        headers such as ``DATE-END`` and ``AZEND`` to be retained to allow
        the header to indicate the range of values.  No exception is raised if
        a key can not be found in a header since this allows a range of
        expected headers to be listed covering multiple instruments.

    Returns
    -------
    merged : `dict`
        Single `dict` combining all the headers using the specified
        combination mode.

    Notes
    -----
    If ``first`` and ``last`` are supplied, the keys from ``first`` are
    handled first, followed by the keys from ``last``.  No check is made to
    ensure that the keys do not overlap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    header : `dict`-like
        Header to correct.
    search_path : `list` or `str`, optional
        Explicit directory paths to search for correction files.
        A single directory path can be given as a string.
    translator_class : `MetadataTranslator`-class, optional
        If not `None`, the class to use to translate the supplied headers
        into standard form. Otherwise each registered translator class will
        be asked in turn if it knows how to translate the supplied header.
    filename : `str`, optional
        Name of the file whose header is being translated.  For some
        datasets with missing header information this can sometimes
        allow for some fixups in translations.

    -------

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        Raised if the supplied translation class is not a `MetadataTranslator`.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to determine that a header update is required it is
    necessary for the header to be handled by the supplied translator
    class or else support automatic translation class determination.
    It is also required that the ``observation_id`` and ``instrument``
    be calculable prior to header fix up.  If a translator class can not
    be found or if there is a problem determining the instrument or
    observation ID, the function will return without action.

    Correction files use names of the form ``instrument-obsid.yaml`` (for
    example ``LATISS-AT_O_20190329_000022.yaml``).
    The YAML file should have the format of:

    .. code-block:: yaml

        EXPTIME: 30.0
        IMGTYPE: bias

    where each key/value pair is copied directly into the supplied header,
    overwriting any previous values.

    This function searches a number of locations for such a correction file.
    The search order is:

    - Any paths explicitly supplied through ``search_path``.
    - The contents of the PATH-like environment variable
      ``$METADATA_CORRECTIONS_PATH``.
    - Any search paths supplied by the matching translator class.

    The first file located in the search path is used for the correction.
