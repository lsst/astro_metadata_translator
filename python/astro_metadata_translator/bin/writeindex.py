    """Process each file and create JSON index file.

    The index file will have common information in the toplevel.
    There is then a ``__DIFF__`` key that is a dictionary with file
    names as keys and per-file differences as the values in a dict.

    Parameters
    ----------
    files : iterable of `str`
        The files or directories from which the headers are to be read.
    regex : `str`
        Regular expression string used to filter files when a directory is
        scanned.
    hdrnum : `int`
        The HDU number to read. The primary header is always read and merged
        with the specified header.
    print_trace : `bool`
        If there is an error reading the file and this parameter is `True`,
        a full traceback of the exception will be reported. If `False` prints
        a one line summary of the error condition.
    content_mode : `str`
        Form of data to write in index file. Options are:
        ``translated`` (default) to write ObservationInfo to the index;
        ``metadata`` to write native metadata headers to the index.
        The index file is called ``_index.json``.
    outpath : `str`, optional
        If specified a single index file will be written to this location
        combining all the information from all files. If `None`, the default,
        and index file will be written to each directory in which files
        are found.
    outstream : `io.StringIO`, optional
        Output stream to use for standard messages. Defaults to `sys.stdout`.
    errstream : `io.StringIO`, optional
        Stream to send messages that would normally be sent to standard
        error. Defaults to `sys.stderr`.

    Returns
    -------
    okay : `list` of `str`
        All the files that were processed successfully.
    failed : `list` of `str`
        All the files that could not be processed.
