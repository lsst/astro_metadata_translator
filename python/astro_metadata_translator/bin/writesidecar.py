    Parameters
    ----------
    file : `str`
        The file from which the header is to be read.
    hdrnum : `int`
        The HDU number to read. The primary header is always read and
        merged with the header from this HDU.
    content_mode : `str`
        Content mode to use when writing JSON to sidecar. Options are:
        ``metadata`` to write the unmodified header;
        ``translated`` to write the translated ObservationInfo.
    print_trace : `bool`
        If there is an error reading the file and this parameter is `True`,
        a full traceback of the exception will be reported. If `False` prints
        a one line summary of the error condition. If `None` the exception

        Output stream to use for standard messages. Defaults to `None` which

    success : `bool`
        `True` if the file was handled successfully, `False` if the file
